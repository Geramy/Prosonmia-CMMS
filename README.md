This is a Computerized Maintenance Management Software Project.  
For years there has been tons of companies making these softwares at a huge cost.  
I would like to make this a community effort to create an affordable solution for small businesses.  
My team and I have spent tons of time and money creating this software were it is today, sadly  
we have lost some of our work which has created PHP/DB inconsistency bugs. But the base and design is there.

If you are looking for software that tracks equipment and shipping as well as simple inventory tracking this software does that currently.  
Its still missing the work order feature and task feature but a lot of the work involved in getting that working has already been designed and done.

To get this working on your server you must have reddis server installed and configure it in:  
includes -> config.php  
The next step is to of course install a mysql variant and import the .sql file  
then setup the mysqli configuration file in:  
incldues -> connnect.php
